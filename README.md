# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

A machine learning project that predicts house prices based on housing and socio-economic features.  
The project demonstrates a complete ML workflow including data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

---

## Project Objective

To build a **regression-based machine learning model** that can estimate house prices using structured housing data and analyze the influence of different features on price prediction.
